Description: mod_cloudflare to show visitor IPs in logs.
 Based on mod_remoteip.c, this apache extension will replace the
 remote_ip variable in user's logs with the correct remote_ip sent
 from CloudFlare. This also does authentication, only performing
 the switch for requests originating from CloudFlare IPs.
